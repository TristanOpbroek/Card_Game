# Card_Game
This program plays the card game "War" between two players. It can generate a random hand (using the arugment -s), or pull a hand from a file (using the arugment -f). It plays the game until a winner is decided, and outputs the number of turns as well as the final hand states for each player.

# Sample Output (./main -s 5 7)

# Known Issues
Can get stuck playing a game forever if two opponents have the same hand, or some overlapping subsection of the hand
